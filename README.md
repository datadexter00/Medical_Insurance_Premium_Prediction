Our project, "Medical Insurance Premium Prediction," addresses the intricate challenge faced by insurance firms in balancing affordable premiums for policyholders with financial sustainability. Leveraging advanced analytics and historical data, we constructed robust predictive models to enhance risk assessment, pricing accuracy, and overall operational efficiency for insurance companies. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was meticulously prepared and explored using Tableau and Python's seaborn library, revealing insightful relationships between age, chronic diseases, weight, and average premium prices.

Our predictive models, including Multiple Linear Regression, Boosted Regression Trees, and Random Forest Regression, were rigorously evaluated based on key metrics such as R-squared and Root Mean Squared Error. Notably, Boosted Regression Trees and Random Forest Regression demonstrated superior performance, showcasing strong predictive capabilities.

The project's recommendations emphasize the critical role of age, uncovering the impact of prior surgeries and organ transplants on premium rates. Surprisingly, non-diabetic individuals were found to carry higher premiums, prompting a reassessment of pricing structures for this demographic. The proposed dual-pronged strategy involves enhancing pricing models to comprehensively account for these factors, ultimately benefiting both the organization and policyholders. This project serves as a strategic roadmap for insurance companies, fostering precision, competitiveness, and sustainability in the ever-evolving landscape of medical insurance.
